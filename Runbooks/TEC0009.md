### [TEC0009-CostControl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/TEC0009-CostControl.ps1)

Compares the actual cost accumulated on a resource with the estimated cost value captured in the Tag of the Resource Group. The Runbook retrieves the usage data and calculates cost and writes them into a Log Analytics instance. The actual comparison is performed in Log Analytics.

### Get Usage Data
The resource data is retrieved based on the $StartDateTime and $EndDateTime, for the Resource Groups current data is retrieved. This means that Resources in deleted Resource Groups are supplied, but not the Resource Group itself. 

### Get Rate Card
The $OfferDurableId is used to retrieve the rate cards. [EA rate cards are currently not supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-usage-rate-card-overview#azure-resource-ratecard-api-preview), instead 'MS-AZR-0017P' will be used. These rate cards do not include customer specific discounts but should be sufficient for a cost approximation.

**Configure Application in AAD for Access to Rate Card**<br/>
Access to the rate cards is possibly using REST only. This requires and Azure AD access token, which in turn requires an Azure AD registered Application ID. This application must be `native` and not `Web app / API`.<br/>
