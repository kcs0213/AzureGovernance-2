### [TEC0004-GitHubImportAll](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/TEC0004-GitHubImportAll.ps1)

Used to import the Runbooks from GitHub into the Azure Automation Account in which TEC0004 is executed. The import deletes all Runbooks in the Azure Automation Account, prior to importing them from GitHub. 

An exception are Runbooks with a Webhook configured. These Runbooks are not deleted prior to the import as this would render the Webhook unusable. This means that Runbooks with Webhooks need to be deleted manually if they are no longer used.

Runbooks are imported with verbose logging on, a description 'Imported from GitHub' and in a published state.
