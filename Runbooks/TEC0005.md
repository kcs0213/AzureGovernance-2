### [TEC0005-AzureContextSet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/TEC0005-AzureContextSet.ps1)

Performs a login to the to the Azure Subscription using the Account configured in the Azure Automation Assets:
* VAR-AUTO-SubscriptionName
* CRE-AUTO-AutomationUser

Optionally a default Storage Account can be set. This is useful in cases where access to the Core Storage Account is required, e.g. for access to Azure Tables with reference data.

The Azure context that is set in the parent (Solution) runbook is passed to the child (Pattern) runbooks (see section ‘Calling Runbooks’). In most Pattern runbooks the context is set despite it being passed from the calling runbook:
* It simplifies testing of the Pattern runbooks
* Context switch for access to another storage account 
* Context switch for actions in another Subscription

A `Suspend-Workflow` and `Checkpoint-Workflow` will lose the context. Therefore the context has to be reset after these commands. TEC0005 is also used for setting and resetting the context in these scenarios. This runbook is built that in case of a failure it has to be resumed/stopped manually in the Azure portal.
