### [TEC0010-ExportUsageData](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/TEC0010-ExportUsageData.ps1)

The Runbook exports the usage data of all Subscriptions (to which the technical users has access to) to a Log Analytics instance. Each Resource is stored with the related Resource Group and the accumulated cost per Resource.

The following query is used in Log Analytics to create a report that details the accumulated cost by Resource Group. This report can be [exported to Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/powerbi#export-query).

```powershell
//
// This query retrieves the latest data set that was written by the Runbook TEC0010-ExportUsageData into Log Analytics using the type CostMonitoring_CL
// and summarizes the cost on Resource Group level.
//
let LatestDataSet = CostMonitoring_CL                                              // Create table with latest data set written to OMS
| join kind=inner
(CostMonitoring_CL | project TimeGenerated | top 1 by TimeGenerated desc)          // Determine the TimeGenerated of the last set of data written to the workspace
on TimeGenerated;
LatestDataSet | summarize sum(toreal(Cost_s)) by ResourceGroupName_s
```
