### Log Analytics Workspace
The Log Analytics Workspace is created in the indicated Resource Group, that must be existing. If a Log Analytics Workspace with the same name is already present, then the counter is incremented, e.g. cusweutecore02.

Log Analytics is available in certain [Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=log-analytics&regions=all) only. If a Log Analytics instance is required in a Region that is not currently supported, the naming of the Resource is based on the Region for which that instance is operated - not the region where it's actually deployed.
