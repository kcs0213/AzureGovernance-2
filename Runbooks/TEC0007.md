### [TEC0007-ExportPowerShellModules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/TEC0007-ExportPowerShellModules.ps1)

Exports the PowerShell Modules as well as all the dependent modules of a Hybrid Runbook Worker to a PowerShell Repository on an Azure Files share in the Core Storage Account. The PowerShell Modules are exported from the Hybrid Runbook Worker where this Runbook is executed. 

For the following reasons this Runbook doesn't support execution on a Azure Automation Server:
* Nuget is required but is not available and can't be installed on Azure Automation servers
* Azure Automation only supports ZIP as a format to import Modules. 
* To create the ZIPed version of the Modules, they first need to be downloaded from PowerShell Gallery - which requires Nuget

Another implementation option would be to only save the Module names and retrieve the Modules on the target server by downloading them from PowerShell Gallery. This would however not support Modules not available in PowerShell Gallery.
