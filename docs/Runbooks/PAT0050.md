### [PAT0050-NetworkVnetNew](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/PAT0050-NetworkVnetNew.ps1)

Creates the default VNET with a Frontend, Backend and Management Subnet in the existing network Resource Group. A Route Table is created as are Service Endpoints and connections to Network Security Groups.<br/>
This Pattern creates the default VNET only (e.g. weu-te-vnt-01) and can't be used to create additional VNET instances in a Subscription/Region. By design only a single VNET is maintained per Subscription/Region.

### VNET
Creates the default VNET with a Frontend, Backend and Management Subnet in the '-rsg-network-01' Resource Group. The counter is set to '01', this pattern can't be used to create multiple VNET instances. Example:<br/>
VNET:               weu-te-vnt-01<br/>
Frontend Subnet:    weu-te-sub-vnt01-fe<br/>
Backend Subnet:     weu-te-sub-vnt01-be<br/>
Management Subnet:  weu-te-sub-vnt01-be<br/>

The IP address ranges for the VNET and the Subnets are retrieved from the Azure Table Ipam in the core Storage Account. The table serves multiple purposes:<br/>
* Available IP address ranges for the creation of new VNETs
* Splitting of a VNET IP address range into sub-ranges for the Frontend and Backend Subnets
* VNET and Subnet names for the IP address ranges assigned to a VNET
* IP address assignments, capturing which IP addresses are used and by what resource

### Route Table
A Route Table is created and associated with the Frontend Subnet. By default the Backend and Management Subnets don't have a Route Table associated. The Route Table is not populated with any route entries. The route entries are created once access e.g. to another Subscription or on-premise is required. 

### Network Security Groups (NSGs)
Connects the Subnets to the existing NSGs. There are no NSG rules applied - this is done by use of [PAT0058-NetworkSecurityGroupSet](PAT0058).

### Service Endpoints
Configures Service Endpoints for Microsoft.Storage to allow for Storage Account integration into VNET. Service Endpoints for Storage are configured as they are likely used by other deployments. 

### Tags
The VNET and Route Table are tagged with identical name:value pairs.
