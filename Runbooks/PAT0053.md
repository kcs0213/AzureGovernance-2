### [PAT0053-NetworkVnetPeeringNew](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/PAT0053-NetworkVnetPeeringNew.ps1)

Creates a VNET peering between two VNETs. The Pattern verifies if a peering between two VNETs is already in place. The peering created is always between the Core Subscription VNET and a Standard/Special Subscription VNET. There are no peerings directly between Standard or Special Subscription VNETs.

### VNET Assignment
$Vnet1Name is the Core VNET Subscription and $Vnet2Name is the Standard/Special Subscription VNET. This is important because the Peering is configured accordingly:<br/>
`$Vnet1 = -AllowForwardedTraffic -AllowGatewayTransit`<br/>
`$Vnet2 = -AllowForwardedTraffic -UseRemoteGateways`<br/><br/>
`AllowForwardedTraffic`is configured to allow the forwarded traffic from the virtual machines in the remote virtual network. This is supported in both directions.<br/>
The remote gateway configuration is such that the VNET in the Standard/Special Subscription can us the Gateway in the Core Subscription.
