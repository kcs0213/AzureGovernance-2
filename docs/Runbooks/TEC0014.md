### [TEC0014-PolicyImport](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/TEC0014-PolicyImport.ps1)

Imports Azure Policies from GitHub into a specified Subscription. There are three policy files in JSON format that are required for a sinlge Policy:
- <policy>.metadata.json
- <policy>.parameters.json
- <policy>.rule.json

The metadata file contains the following attributes that are used when importing the Policy into the Subscription:
- name: Name of to Policy
- displayname: Display name of the Policy
- description: Description of the Policy - since JSON doesn't support comments all information is captured in this attribute

The Parameters and Rule files are the standard Azure Policy files used for defining the Policy and the required parameters. 

A fourth file without any extension, but simply named <policy>.json represents the Policy definition as it's used when creating the Policy in the Azure Portal.
