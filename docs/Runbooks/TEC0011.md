### [TEC0011-ResourceGroupCreationMonitor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/TEC0011-ResourceGroupCreationMonitor.ps1)

The Event Grid Subscription instance is monitoring the Subscription for the creation of a new Resource Group. Once a new Resource Group is created TEC0011 is triggered using a Webhook. 

The Webhook of TEC0011 has a ChannelUrl configured that is pointing to a connector in a Teams channel. Using that Webhook TEC0011 is sending a message to the Teams channel.
