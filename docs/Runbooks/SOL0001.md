### [SOL0001-AzureSubscriptionNew](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/SOL0001-AzureSubscriptionNew.ps1)<br/>

Creates a new Subscription in it's most basic design. This baseline implementation can be enhanced by submitting additional Service Requests. This pattern can be used to deploy both Hub and Spoke Subscriptions. The Azure Resources included in this basic design can be deployed to one or multiple regions.<br/>

For the deployment of this solution refer to the [Deployment Instructions](#Deployment-Instructions) at the bottom of this page.

## Hub Design
Below diagram depicts the design of a hub Subscription. The Log Analytics instances and the core Storage Account are deployed in the hub Subscription only. The management Subnet shown in the diagram is not automatically deployed and would have to be created manually - if required.<br/>

## Spoke Design
Below diagram depicts the design of a spoke Subscription. The same Resource Groups are deployed as for a hub Subscription. However, some Resources are not deployed in the spoke Subscription as the centralized Resources in the hub Subscrptions are used (see below).<br/>
The Azure Key Vault is deployed in the Subscription as some Azure Resources required a Key Vault in the same Subscription and Region. The same applies to the diagnostics Storage Account.<br/>

## Multi Region Deployment
If a deployment to multiple regions is chosen the most Resources are deployed to each Region.
* Log Analytics Workspaces are only deployed once. They needs to be deployed to West Europe, East US or Southeast Asia as they are not available in the other Regions. For these Resources the naming convention might not be correct as the Log Analytics Workspace cusneu0010core01 would be running in West Europe. It's preferable to align the naming convention with the logical design, rather than the physical location.
* The diagnostic accounts are deployed to each Region as they must be located in the same Region and location as the VM.
* Key Vaults are also deployed to each Region and Subscription as some Resources using Key Vault require them to be in the same Region and/or Subscription as the Resource using the Key Vault.

## Resources Deployed
### RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
There are no roles assigned on Subscription level, except the one that is (mandatorily) inherited from the Enterprise Portal and the technical account for Azure Automation. RBAC is applied on Resource Group level only. There are no roles assigned on Resource level. Access to Resources is therefore controlled by the RBAC inherited from Subscription and Resource Group level.<br/>
Each Resource Group has a Contributor and a Reader Role assigned. The Reader Role for each Resource Group is (optionally) associated with a single AAD Group that is used for read access to all Resources in a Subscription. The Contributor Role is associated with individual AAD Groups for networking, security and core. 

### Tags
All Resource Groups and Resources are tagged with identical name:value pairs. Individual Tag values need to be configured manually after the deployment. 

### Resource Groups
Three Resource Groups are deployed, that host the core Resources. These are Resources that are generic and therefore available to be used by any Resource in the Subscription. Business workload specific Resource Groups are deployed by use of [SOL0011-AzureResourceGroupNew](SOL0011).

### VNET (Virtual Network)
Each VNET consists of a Frontend and Backend Subnet with associated NSG (Network Security Group). The IP address ranges are retrieved from the [IPAM Solution](PAT0050) solution. Service Endpoints for Microsoft.Storage are created on each of the two Subnets. If required Peerings can by configured by use of [SOL0050-NetworkUcToUcNew](SOL0050).

### Route Table
A single Route Table without any Routes is created and associated with the Frontend Subnet. 

### NSG (Network Security Group)
An NSG is created for each Subnet and security rules applied. The security rules are retrieved from a CSV file hosted in the Hub Subscription on a file share in the core Storage Account: nsg-rule-set\NsgRuleSets.csv<br/>

The NSGs are associated with the Log Analytics instance for Security operations. 

### Key Vault
A Key Vault instance is deployed and associated with the Log Analytics instance for Security operations.

### Storage Account
A Core Storage Account is created and the Firewall configured. The Firewall allows access from the Subnets and Microsoft Services but not from the Internet or the on-premise network.???<br/>
In the Core Subscription a table is created for [IPAM (IP Address Management)](PAT0050) and a file share with a csv file for [NSG Rules](PAT0058). In cases where the Core Subscription spans multiple regions, these tables are created in the last Region entered in the Service Request form.

### Log Analytics
Two Log Analytics instance are deployed, for Core services and Security. There are no Resources associated with the Core Log Analytics instance. The Security Log Analytics instance has associations from the NSG and Key Vault instances.

Log Analytics is not available in all regions -> refer to [PAT0300-MonitoringWorkspaceNew](PAT0300) for details about the naming convention.

### Policies
The Policy _Allowed locations_ is configured both on Subscription and Resource Group level. On Subscription level the following locations are configured - a pair of Regions in each [Azure Geographic Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/):
* West Europe
* North Europe
* West US
* East US
* Southeast Aisa
* East Asia

The locations on Resource Group level are configured based on the supplied Region and includes two Azure Regions in each [Azure Geographic Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/).

| Geographic Region | Allowed Region|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Europe | North Europe, West Europe |
| US | West US, East US |
| Asia | Southeast Asia, East Asia |

The Policy is assigned on Subscription level and on all Resource Groups. The assignment on both levels is to allow for a narrowing of the regional scope on Resource Group level.

## Deployment Instructions
1. The [Runbook overview diagram](Runbook-Overview.pdf) lists all the Runbooks required by this Solution. Each Runbook lists the required PowerShell Modules. 
2. Use [TEC0004-GitHubImportAll](TEC0004) or [TEC0003-GitHubImportIndividual](TEC0003) to import the Runbooks from the GitHub Repository.
3. Create a WebHook on SOL0001 to be used by the calling HTML page (see below)
4. Create the following AAD Groups to regulate access to:
- Network Resources
- Security Resources
- Core Resources
- Read Access to all Resources
5. Deploy or Update the [Azure Web App](Azure-Web-App) used as a portal to trigger the Service Request. Or use your own portal. Update the following on in [SOL0001-AzureSubscriptionNew.html](https://github.com/fbodmer/felportal/blob/master/SOL0001-AzureSubscriptionNew.html):
- WebHook defined above `xhttp.open("POST", "https://s2events.azure-automation.net/webhooks?token=...`
- Landing page `window.open("https://weu-co-aps-felportal-01.azurewebsites.net/");`
6. Load additional PowerShell Modules. Most likely:<br/>
```powershellInstall-Module AzureRM.OperationalInsights, AzureRM.KeyVault, AzureRM.Insights, AzureRM.Network, AzureRmStorageTable```
7. Define the missing Azure Automation Variable and Credential Assets. Most likely:<br/>
```powershell
New-AzureRmAutomationVariable -AutomationAccountName weu-co-aut-prod-01 `
                              -ResourceGroupName weu-co-rsg-automation-01 `
                              -Name VAR-AUTO-WorkspaceCoreName `
                              -Value <customershortcode>weucocore01 `
                              -Encrypt $false
New-AzureRmAutomationVariable -AutomationAccountName weu-co-aut-prod-01 `
                              -ResourceGroupName weu-co-rsg-automation-01 `
                              -Name VAR-AUTO-WorkspaceSecurityName `
                              -Value <customershortcode>weucosecurity01 `
                              -Encrypt $false
```

8. Ensure to first create the Core Subscription as this is required for the non-core Subscriptions
9. Update the NSG Rule csv file in the Core Storage account and apply the updated rules (the initial deployment used some dummy rules)
10. Update the IPAM Azure Table in the Core Storage account to correspond with the VNET/Subnet address ranges.
