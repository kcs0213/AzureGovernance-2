### [SOL0300-AppsWebAppNew](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbodmer/AzureGovernance/master/SOL0300-AppsWebAppNew.ps1)
Creates a new App Service Plan with a new Web App. This version doesn't automatically increase the counter in the Resource name. It also doesn't offer support for using an existing App Service Plan.<br/>

The Web App is connected to the master branch in a GitHub repository.<br/>

The Web App instance is registered as an application in AAD. In addition the Web App is configured to use AAD Authentication/Authorization. Supported are only accounts in the AAD. <br/>
